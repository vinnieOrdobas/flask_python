<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain.
            Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug
            in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria.
            At some
            point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he
            gained
            the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of
            Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose,
            the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Oin's uncle was King
            Fundin, the
            father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle
            of
            Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to
            reclaim the
            Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with
            them to
            reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the
            Company
            as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies,
            and later
            settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dain Ironfoot II along with many other dwarves of The Company of
            Thorin.

        <h3>Gloin</h3>
        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the Dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
            younger brother of Óin.

            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown what significance he did, being 16 years old.

            In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
            March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to
            reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't start an alliance with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned hobbits, Glóin
            referred them as "simpletons" and also said that hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance
            of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

        <h3>Dwalin</h3>
        <p>
            Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger
            brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thrain the Second
            and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.
        
            Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered
            Luin to visit Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one
            night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search
            for their leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.

            the dragon Smaug.
        
            Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the forks"; as
            well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his grumbling”. He often wore
            a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the strongest of the thirteen
            companions.
